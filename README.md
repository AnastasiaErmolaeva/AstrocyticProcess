# AstrocyticProcess

Here we propose a computational model of the astrocytic process.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio ≥ 2019
- The minimum required amount of RAM is 16 GB

### Installing

Clone repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/AnastasiaErmolaeva/AstrocyticProcess.git
```

### Running the experiment

To run the default experiment execute `main.cpp`.

The simulation model time is 50000 seconds. The time step is 0.01 seconds.
The program run time for default parameters is around 1.5 hours.

### Results

The following results are presented at the end of the simulation: intracellular calcium concentration in astrocytes.
 
### Parameters

File in.txt consists of model parameters, including:
- Astrocytic process size
- Quantity of leaflets
- Diffusion coefficients
- Compartment radius
- Noise intensity
- Timeline
